# Installing Git

[Previous - Git Basics](../README.md)

Before working on a Git repository, you will need to install Git on your computer.
This process varies depending on your operating system.

### Installing on Windows

Visit [this page](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to see a list of available
Windows installers for Git.

### Installing on MacOS

If on MacOS Mavericks 10.9 or above, you can automatically initiate the Git
installer by running the following command in a terminal:

`git --version`

Git is included with Xcode Command Line Tools, so if the above command does
not start the Git installer, simply installing Xcode should install Git for you.

Additional installation methods for Git on MacOS are available [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### Installing on Linux

Most distributions of Linux offer Git as an installable package through their
built in package manager. Because different distributions use different
package managers, the command to install Git will depend on which distribution
you are using.

Visit [this page](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) for a list of distributions and the install command for each.
